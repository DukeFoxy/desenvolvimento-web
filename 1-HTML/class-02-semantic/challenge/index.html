                <p>
                    Falling too fast to prepare for this <br>
                    Tripping in the world could be dangerous <br>

                    Whip, whip
                    Run me like a racehorse <br>
                    Pull me like a ripcord <br>
                    Break me down and build me up <br>
                    I wanna be the slip, slip <br>

                <p>
                    Always had a fear of being typical <br>
                    Looking at my body feeling miserable <br>
                    Always hanging on to the visual <br>

                    Looking at my years like a martyrdom <br>
                    Everybody needs to be a part of 'em <br>
                    Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son <br>
                    I was born to run, I was born for this <br>
