                <p>
                    Falling too fast to prepare for this <br>
                    Tripping in the world could be dangerous <br>
                    Everybody circling, it's vulturous <br>
                    Negative, nepotist

                <p>
                    Everybody waiting for the fall of man <br>
                    Everybody praying for the end of times <br>
                    Everybody hoping they could be the one <br>
                    I was born to run, I was born for this

                    Whip, whip
                    Run me like a racehorse <br>
                    Pull me like a ripcord <br>
                    Break me down and build me up <br>
                    I wanna be the slip, slip <br>
                    Word upon your lip, lip <br>
                    Letter that you rip, rip <br>
                    Break me down and build me up <br>

                    'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins <br>
                    I do whatever it takes <br>

                <p>
                    Always had a fear of being typical <br>
                    Looking at my body feeling miserable <br>
                    Always hanging on to the visual <br>
                    I wanna be invisible <br>

                <p>
                    Looking at my years like a martyrdom <br>
                    Everybody needs to be a part of 'em <br>
                    Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son <br>
                    I was born to run, I was born for this <br>

                <h2>Parte 9</h2>
                <p>
                    Hypocritical, egotistical <br>
                    Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical <br>
                    Working onto something that I'm proud of, out of the box <br>
                    An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost <br>
                    I'm an apostrophe <br>
                    I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see <br>
                    I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe <br>
                    And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased <br>
                    And when I am deceased <br>
                    At least I go down to the grave and die happily <br>
                    Leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee <br>
                    I do what it takes <br>
                </p>
